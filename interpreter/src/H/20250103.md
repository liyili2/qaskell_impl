Quantum circuits are explicitly mentioned in several parts of the paper:

1. **Introduction (Page 1)**: The paper highlights the challenge of programming quantum computers using traditional circuit-based models and mentions the disconnection between quantum machine realities and programming languages that rely on low-level circuit details.

   - *"Many quantum programming languages contain too many low-level circuit details, and programming in these frameworks requires the care of these details..."*

2. **Compilation Section (Page 1)**: The authors emphasize bypassing quantum circuit level compilation by providing a higher-level energy-constrained programming paradigm through EnQ.

   - *"We show how our Haskell energy-constrained programs can be compiled to the quantum language effectively by bypassing quantum circuit level compilation."*

3. **Formalism (Page 9)**: It discusses how Hamiltonian evolution can be implemented as quantum circuits, particularly through unitary operators derived from matrix exponentiation.

   - *"Since \( \hat{H} \) is a Hermitian matrix, the matrix exponent produces a unitary that can be implemented as quantum circuits."*

4. **Quantum Interpretation with Examples (Page 12)**: This section reiterates that the Hamiltonian evolution, when implemented, corresponds to unitary operations realizable as quantum circuits.

These references explicitly link the paperâ€™s theoretical framework and practical implementation to quantum circuits as a means to realize the described quantum computations.
